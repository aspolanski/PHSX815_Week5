## PHSX815_Week5

# Homework 5 Notes:

* Added two scripts, *1d_sample.py* and *2d_sample.py*, which perform rejection sampling for either a 1D or 2D case.

* The 1D case is sampling the function sin^2(x) using a uniform proposal distribution

* The 2D case samples a 2D Lorentz function using a uniform proposal distribution. I couldn't get this one to work properly, something is wrong with how the histogram and/or the target function is normalized I think.

# Homework 6 Notes:

* Added a script to /Homework6/python, *integrator.py*. This script performs numerical integration of a function using the Trapezoid rule. The function in that script is the sine squared function.

* Did not complete the Gaussian quadrature part of this assignment, an emergency took most of my time, sorry!
