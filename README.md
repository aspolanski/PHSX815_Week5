## PHSX815_Week5

#Homework 5 Notes:

* Added two scripts, *1d_sample.py* and *2d_sample.py*, which perform rejection sampling for either a 1D or 2D case.

* The 1D case is sampling the function sin^2(x) using a uniform proposal distribution

* The 2D case samples a 2D Lorentz function using a uniform proposal distribution. I couldn't get this one to work properly, something is wrong with how the histogram and/or the target function is normalized I think.
